    * Headphones mode will make the device send audio through the headphone jack. Please be aware that you must plug headphones into the passthrough port on the adapter to hear audio in this mode!
    * Speakers mode will force the device to send audio through the built in speakers. Please not that this is NOT COMPATIBLE with Android 4 and Android 5!
