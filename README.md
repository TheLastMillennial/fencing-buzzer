# Fencing Buzzer Box
#### 2019 : Brian K. & Erik F.
#### Compatible with Android 4 and newer.

This project emulates a buzz box for épée and foil. 

### To create the adapter:
 - Navigate to the Hardware folder
 - Refer to PartsList.txt for the list of parts needed
 - Refer to FencingCircuitSchematic4.png for the circuit diagram
 - Refer to FinishedProduct.jpg for the finished product

### To install the app:
 - Open Settings
 - Navigate to 'Security'
 - Find 'Unknown Sources' or 'Install Unknown Apps'
   * On old OSes, just tap on the switch to enable the option
   * On new OSes, enable the feature on the app you will try to install from (i.e. Files or Chrome)
 - Navigate to the fencingbuzzer.apk file and install it.

### To use the app:
There are three buttons. 
 - The right button plays a test beep.
 - The middle button changes the audio output for the beep. 
    * Headphones mode will make the device send audio through the headphone jack. Please be aware that you must use a TRRS headphone jack splitter to hear audio in this mode!
    * Speakers mode will force the device to send audio through the built in speakers. Please note: on Android 4 & 5 your notification sound will be used due to compatibility issues.
 - The button on the left changes which blade is being used and will change the beep behavior accordingly.

There are two sliders.
 - The top slider 'locks' the screen by removing all clickable buttons and forcing the screen to stay on.
 - The bottom slider adjusts the tone of the beep.
